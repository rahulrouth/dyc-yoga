                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Devine Yoga Center's Strength Yoga is a fast-paced cardio workout that 
                    focuses on building strength and flexibility through high-impact yoga poses. 
                    The definition of strength yoga varies depending on where you practice it.
                    If you think yoga is just bending and twisting your body into weird shapes, 
                    it's time to think again. It is much more than that. Simply put, taking care of 
                    your body, mind and breath is yoga. This means a centuries-old practice that 
                    includes yoga poses, breathing techniques, and meditation. Thanks to them, 
                    the body, mind and breath are attuned to each other and it is this moment 
                    when yoga comes into being.

                <h5>Vinyasa yoga</h5>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Vinyasa is the opposite of hatha. Hatha classes focus on one pose at a time, 
                    resting in between. In contrast, series of line layers stack together to form a 
                    sequence.
                    The sequence can be fixed, as in Ashtanga, where the poses are always 
                    performed in the same order. But most of the time, vinyasa teachers have 
                    full control over the course of the poses in their own way. vinyasa yoga 
                    represents each movement with synchronized breath. The breath takes 
                    precedence, acting as an anchor as you move from one pose to the next.
                    The cat-cow stretch is a very simple example of vinyasa. The spine is arched 
                    to inspiration and rounded at expiration. The sun salutation sequence is a 
                    more complex vinyasa. Each movement in the sequence is signaled by an 
                    inspiration or the end of the breath.

                <h5>Ashtanga yoga</h5>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Devine Yoga Center offers ashtanga yoga also known as eight limbs of yoga. 
                    The eight limbs form a sequence from the outside to the inside. The poses, 
                    important in modern yoga as an exercise, constitute only one member of 
                    Patanjali's plan; it just says they have to be stable and comfortable. 
                    The main focus is on kaivalya, Purusha's distinction, the conscious witness, 
                    separation from prakriti, the cognitive apparatus, and Purusha's detachment 
                    from its confused defilements. Several key principles underlie the practice of 
                    Ashtanga. This multi-pronged approach promotes mental and physical 
                    health.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Yin Yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga as an exercise, combining principles of 
                    traditional Chinese medicine, with asanas (postures) that stretch longer than 
                    other styles. Advanced practitioners can hold the pose for five minutes or 
                    more. The sequence of poses aimed at stimulating the subtle body's 
                    meridians is called meridians in Chinese medicine and nadis in Hatha yoga.
                    Yin Yoga puts moderate pressure on the body's connective tissues - tendons, 
                    muscles and ligaments - with the aim of increasing circulation to the joints 
                    and improving flexibility. A more meditative approach to yoga, the goal of 
                    which is to sense inner stillness and bring to light a universal, interconnected 
                    quality.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Devine yoga center Restorative yoga is a style of yoga that encourages 
                    physical, mental, and emotional relaxation. Suitable for all levels, restorative 
                    yoga is practiced at a slow pace with a focus on holding, stillness, and deep 
                    breathing. Unlike more dynamic yoga styles like Vinyasa or Bikram, doing 
                    only a handful of poses in a single restorative yoga session.
                    Restorative yoga is a passive healing approach. This style of yoga is known 
                    for its ability to activate the parasympathetic nervous system. It's the "rest 
                    and digest" part of your nervous system that helps keep basic functions 
                    working properly.
                    As the name suggests, this yoga style "restores" the body to the function of 
                    the parasympathetic nervous system, thereby helping the body to rest, heal 
                    and restore balance.

                <h5>Pranayama</h5>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Pranayama in DYC is an ancient breathing technique that originated in yogic 
                    practice in Siliguri. It involves controlling your breath in different patterns 
                    and lengths. It has recently gained popularity in the Western world due to 
                    the many health benefits derived from practicing pranayama.
                    Pranayama is often practiced alongside yoga. He is known as the fourth 
                    anga, or member of yoga. Pranayama is considered a science. It is believed 
                    that you can control the power of your mind by regulating your breathing. 
                    The word pranayama comes from two separate words, prana and ayama. 
                    Prana translates to breath, while ayama has many different meanings 
                    including extension, length, and height. In yogic beliefs, it is believed that 
                    you can control your inner power, also known as prana, through the practice 
                    of pranayama. 
                    These meanings focus on the ability of a pranayama practice to develop 
                    control of the breath and improve mental health. Breathing heavily 
                    pranayama is also said to help detoxify your body.

                <h5>Meditation</h5>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses mindfulness or focuses 
                    attention on a specific object, thought, or action to train attention and 
                    awareness and achieve mental clarity and emotional peace and stability.
                    Meditation is practiced in many religious traditions. The earliest records of 
                    dhyana meditation are found in the Upanishads, and meditation plays a 
                    prominent role in the contemplative treasures of Buddhism and Hinduism. 
                    Since the 19th century, Asian meditation techniques have spread to other 
                    cultures, where they are also applied in non-spiritual contexts, such as 
                    business and health.
                    Meditation can significantly reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, 
                    while improving peace, awareness, self-concept, and happiness. Research is 
                    underway to better understand the effects of meditation on psychological, 
                    neurological, cardiovascular, and other health.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Yoga therapy is the application of yoga practices to alleviate physical and 
                    mental health problems with the goal of promoting self-care and promoting 
                    overall well-being. Although the practice of yoga in general is aimed at 
                    physical and mental training and therefore has the potential to be 
                    therapeutic, in yoga therapy we use specific yoga practices and their known 
                    benefits to help alleviate or improve mental and physical ailments.
                    Devine Yoga Center Yoga therapy is a growing service and has begun to 
                    focus on its effectiveness. It is used to treat existing physical and mental 
                    health problems, but can also be used as a self-care strategy for prevention 
                    and maintenance. Yoga therapy is considered a treatment for depression 
                    and anxiety.
